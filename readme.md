# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in Python

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Python. It includes functions for inserting, searching, traversing (inorder), and deleting nodes from the tree.

## 📂 Files
- `bst.py` - Contains the implementation of the Binary Search Tree.
- `README.md` - Instructions on how to execute the script.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running:
```sh
python --version
```
If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## 🚀 How to Run the Script

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
If using Git:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dhruvancvt/BST_Video1
cd bst-python
```
Or manually download `bst.py` and navigate to its directory.

### 2️⃣ Run the Python Script
Execute the script using the following command:
```sh
python bst.py
```
(Use `python3 bst.py` if you have both Python 2 and 3 installed.)

## 🖥 Expected Output
After running `bst.py`, you should see an output like this:
```sh
Inorder traversal of BST:
20 30 40 50 60 70 80
Searching for 40: True
Deleting 50
Inorder traversal after deletion:
20 30 40 60 70 80
```

## 📚 Features Implemented
- **Insertion:** Adds elements to the BST while maintaining the BST properties.
- **Search:** Finds if a given key exists in the tree.
- **Inorder Traversal:** Displays the tree elements in sorted order.
- **Deletion:** Removes a node while ensuring the tree remains valid.
